# 📜 Privacy Policy

### 🛡️ Overview
This Privacy Policy outlines the data practices for our Chrome Extension, designed exclusively for National Taiwan University (NTU) students to calculate their GPA and export their credits and grades to a CSV file. We value your privacy and want to make it clear that our extension operates entirely on the frontend and does **not** collect, store, or share any user data.

Also, we release our work so the community can help improve this extension.

### 📊 Data Collection
Our extension does **not** collect any data from you. The GPA calculations and CSV exports are performed entirely on your device, ensuring that:

- **🔒 No Data is Collected**: All processing is done locally within your browser. 
- **💻 Local Operations**: Your academic data, such as grades and credits, are only processed in your browser and are not transmitted anywhere.

### 🔄 Data Usage
Since our extension does not collect any data, there is no data usage to disclose. All GPA calculations and CSV exports are handled directly on your device:

- **📐 GPA Calculation**: The GPA is calculated within the extension based on the data you input, and the results are immediately displayed to you.
- **💾 CSV Export**: You can export your grades and credits to a CSV file, which is stored directly on your device.

### 🔒 Data Sharing
We guarantee that:

- **🔐 No Data Sharing**: We do not, and cannot, share any of your data because none is collected in the first place.

### 📥 Access to Privacy Policy
You can always access the most up-to-date Privacy Policy via the link provided in the designated field in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
